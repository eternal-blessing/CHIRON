# Chiron Documentation

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                 | Recommended Solution                                                                            |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Webcam Not Detected      | Verify webcam is properly connected and not in use by another application. Restart Chiron.     |
| Poor Gesture Accuracy    | Ensure adequate and consistent lighting. Keep your hand fully visible and within camera view.  |
| High Latency / Frame Drops | Close other resource-intensive applications. Confirm that your system meets minimum hardware specifications. |
| Unresponsive Key Controls | Confirm that the target game supports keyboard input and that Chiron has necessary OS permissions for input simulation. |



## Configuration

- Gesture-to-key mappings can be conveniently customized via the GUI or by editing the `config.json` file.
- All configuration changes can be saved and applied immediately without restarting the application, enabling quick iteration on control schemes.



## Development Guidelines

- **Code Style:** All source code adheres to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standards to ensure readability and maintainability.
- **Modular Architecture:** The project is organized into clear, loosely coupled modules:
  - `chiron_core.py` – Central application logic and workflow
  - `webcam_interface.py` – Webcam video capture and processing
  - `gesture_processing.py` – Gesture recognition and machine learning pipeline
  - `game_integration.py` – Keyboard input simulation and game control integration
  - `config_manager.py` – Configuration file parsing and management
- **Documentation:** Public functions, classes, and modules include comprehensive docstrings explaining purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions.
- **Testing:** All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by appropriate unit and integration tests. Tests must pass before merging.



## Future Enhancements

- Support for multi-modal inputs, integrating voice commands alongside gestures for richer interactivity.
- Adaptive learning algorithms to personalize gesture recognition based on individual user characteristics and environmental variables.
- Context-aware gesture interpretation that adjusts functionality dynamically based on game state or user intent.
- Exploration and integration of advanced AI models such as Transformer networks and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable more complex and semantically rich gesture understanding.
- Extension to multi-hand recognition, enabling more complex control schemes and collaborative gameplay.
- Addition of accessibility features, including adjustable gesture sensitivity and alternative feedback mechanisms, to support a diverse range of users.
